- Leaning an encoer can be in two ways
	1. Reconstroction.
	2. Predicition.
	- For example in RL, we can learning representations from image by training an autoencoder, or by training a cnn to predict the actiona/reward/states from images and use that as our state encoder.
	- Uniform distrbution are maxiumu entropy for the state/probability space.
