## Chapter 2 probability 
### 2.1 What is porbability 
There are two views of a probability:
1. Frequentist view, which interprets probabilities as long term frequencies.
2. Bayesian view, which interprets probabilites as a quantification of our uncertainty about an event.
Examples
- If I flip a coin it will land head with 0.5 probability
	- Frequentist: It will land head half of the time (if we fliped many many times)
	- Bayesian: Landing head or tail is qually likely.
#### comment about the Bayesian view
It allow us to assign probabilities to events that do not happen many times or can not be done in trails becuase we do not have control over them, for example the probability of melting of the polar ice cap by 2020, or the probability of an email message to be a spam or not.
#### Discrete random variables
A random variable that takes its values from a finite set or a infintly countable set.
###### some useful properties and functions
- The Indicator function: a function that returns either zero or one dependeing on its input, if the input evaluate to true it will return one otherwise, it will return zero.
$I(x=1) = 1$ if $x=1$ otherwise $I = 0$.
- The porbability of a Union of two
